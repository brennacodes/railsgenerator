# Rails Generator

A blazing-fast tool to easily generate Rails generator commands from your SQL files.

## Live app [here](https://www.railsgenerator.com)

## What is it?

Rails Generator allows you to take your PostgreSQL file and create `rails generate resource...` commands from it. It takes the guesswork out of resource, scaffold, controller, model, migration creation and more, helping to eliminate errors and get your project started faster.

## Limitations
- currently only supports PostgreSQL and DDL (from Postico) sql
- some generator commands may not be properly formatted yet

## Planned Development
- Add support for MySQL & SQLite
- Complete support for all generators

## Development

The app was created over the course of a two days. It is written in Svelte and deployed on Vercel.
