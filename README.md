# Rails Generator

A blazing-fast tool to easily generate Rails generator commands from your SQL files.

## Live app [here](https://www.railsgenerator.com)

## What is it?

Rails Generator allows you to take your PostgreSQL file and create `rails generate resource...` commands from it. It takes the guesswork out of resource, scaffold, controller, model, migration creation and more, helping to eliminate errors and get your project started faster.

## Limitations
- currently only supports PostgreSQL sql files
- currently only generates commands for resources

## Planned Development
- Add support for MySQL & SQLite
- Add support for all of Rails' generators
- Add information on what will be generated from the sql files including visual representations of what the output will be after running them

## Development

The app was created over the course of a day. It is written in Svelte and deployed on Vercel.
